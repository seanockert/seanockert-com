# Learning Widgets

Three small apps for teaching kids in the classroom. Mostly just an excuse to play around with [Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue)

## Demo

- [Countdown Timer](https://so-learning-widgets-demo.surge.sh/timer/)
- [Hundreds Number Grid](https://so-learning-widgets-demo.surge.sh/number-grid/)
- [Analog Clock with Draggable Hands](https://so-learning-widgets-demo.surge.sh/analog-clock/)

## Installation

Nothing to install! Petite Vue doesn't require a huge node_modules folder or any compilation step
